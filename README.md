# Canals and Rivers: A comparison
This site uses maps and 3d illustrations to highlight some differences between canals and Rivers. For the sake of example, we explore the Tampa Bypass canal and the Alafia River.  Additionally, the role of remote sensing is explored.

## River banks vs Canal banks

### River Banks

Natural rivers may have shallower banks

In this particular image, the height is exagerated by 30 times

### Canal Banks

In this particular image, the height is exagerated by 30 times

Canal banks may be steeper, allow certain land use to be closer in.  In the google map below, note how close Tampa Executive airport and many structures are to the Tampa Bypass canal.

## Canal Course vs River Course

This map illustrates that rivers may wander considerably. This can impact land use planning. It also creates point bars, peninsula-like features that may present interesting development or conservation opportunities.

## Elevation
Elevation may vary more near a river than near a canal.
In these images, red is lower elevation.  Elevation climbes from red through yellows to greens.  _As usual, true North is toward the top of the image_
### Canal Elevation

### River Elevation
Note the broader elevation of the river, which poses more of a flood risk
